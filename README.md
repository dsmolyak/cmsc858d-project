Semester Project for CMSC858D:  Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction for Single
Cell Data

Daniel Smolyak & Anton Goretsky

All code is available in the ipynb notebooks, the main dependencies are `sklearn` and `umap` (`pip install umap-learn`)

Some data is available in the `data` folder, and downloads for larger datasets are indicated in the notebooks (all should be downloaded into the `data` folder). Much of this code replicated from Kobak and Berens (2019).
